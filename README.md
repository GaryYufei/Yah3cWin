# Yah3cWin
A Yah3c client on windows for SYSU Eastern Campus (located in Higher Education Mega Centre, HEMC) 

## Project Background

This is a pretty early project, which starts in July, 2013. At the time, I would like to make improvement for SYSU Yah3c client. As we know, Yah3c client is a thing that SYSU students would never miss because they need to get online everyday. It is a perfect information flow in the campus. However, the offical version is huge (over 90MB) and its UI design and using experience are poor. I decide to develop a new Yah3c client for both convience and comerical purpose.

## Existed work

In order to build up a new client, the first thing is to understand how campus network works. At that time, I have limited knowledge about network and it seems impossible for me to work it out.

Thanks for the work of [Maple](https://github.com/humiaozuzu/), his project [Yah3c](https://github.com/humiaozuzu/YaH3C) is similar to my plan. However, this project is only avaiable for Linux-based system. Since the network implenment is quite different between windows and linux, this project privides me most of the network protecol knowledge, which are important.

## Project completeness

This project completes the core code for connection to SYSU network center. I finish this code at the beginning of August, 2013. After that, I went to Brisbane, Australia for my 2+2 exchange plan. I am now in the University of Queensland. It still needs a GUI. I tried to use QT but failed due to the insuffient time. Please feel free to contract me if you have any insterst in this project.
